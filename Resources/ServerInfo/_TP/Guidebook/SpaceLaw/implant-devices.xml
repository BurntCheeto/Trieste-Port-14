 # Implantation
  Any prisoner in custody can be subjected to implantation or implant extraction procedures, so long as it's within reason. The process of adding or extracting an implant should not prolong the detainees sentence, meaning you can not hold them longer to perform the procedure, unless stated otherwise. A former inmate can be requested to undergo implantation/extraction at a later point in time; if they fit the circumstances during their confinement, they must comply. The following have been listed out with special circumstances, anything not in this list can still be applied, given proper legal context. A prisoner can still receive implantation/extraction procedures without meeting the circumstances if they give their clear permission.

  [color=#a4885c]Tracking Implants:[/color] Trackers can be applied to any suspect that has been convicted of a violent crime (the red linked crimes).

  [color=#a4885c]Mind Shields:[/color] Mind Shields can be administered to any suspect charged with a crime if there is reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe they committed the crime while under mind control. If there is undeniable proof of ongoing mind control on the station, such as a successful deconversion, all the following statements apply:

  - Crew can be required to be shielded and may be forcibly implanted if they refuse.
  - If a suspect refuses to cooperate or the implant fails to function they can be charged with Refusal of Mental Shielding.
  - Unlike standard implantation you may indefinitely extend the duration of a prisoner's sentence until you finish issuing Mind Shields, so long as active attempts are made to procure implants and complete the implantation procedure.

  Usage of contraband implanters is a detainable offense, but it's not reasonable to detain someone solely for having an unidentified implant inside them.

  ## Implant Removal
  Any prisoner in custody can be subjected to implant extraction for a specific implant if there is reasonable suspicion they have it implanted. Detainees may not be forced or coerced into performing implant extraction on themselves against their will.
