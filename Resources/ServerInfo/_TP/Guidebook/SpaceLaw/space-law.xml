 # Space Law
  Trieste Port operates under SolGov Space Law. All citizens and visitors aboard the settlement are expected to follow these laws.

  Foreign invaders, such as Cascade Operatives, ninjas, and pirates, are not protected under space law. Traitors are not foreign invaders so are usually protected by space law.

  Space Law is not the server rules, but some rules reference Space Law and require it to be followed by certain people or to some degree.

 ## Command Succession
  The acting head of Trieste is the position of Overseer. When the Overseer is not present, either by absence or hostile situation, an Acting Overseer may be appointed according to this chain:
  - Head of Personnel
  - Marshal
  - Harbormaster
  - Chief Engineer
  - Chief Medical Officer
  - Research Director
  - Warden
  The Acting Overseer inherits all power and responsibility of the Overseer until the acting position is no longer required.

  Succession of Department Heads:
  If any department head is absent or unable to perform their duties, a member of their department may be appointed by the Overseer to be an Acting Head. 
  If the Marshal is absent the Warden assumes the role of Acting Marshal, without requiring approval from the Overseer. 
  Any Acting Head must obtain additional access from the Overseer as soon as possible.
